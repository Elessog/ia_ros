First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor during the project,Luc Jaulin, who were available for all my interrogations and ensured that I was not overwhelmed by my pretensions.

I also would like to thanks Simon Rohou and Thomas Le MÃ©zo for supporting my incessant interruptions for information requests on Ibex and discussing my  work.

And finally, I would like to thank Jordan Ninin for his help in improving the efficiency of my program.

This report allows to conclude that for our project the interval methods is more appropriate (here robots could go near mines so we need a guaranteed localization).The next thing to do is to put our problem into an equation, the SLAM with one robot will be more or less easy as it has been done a few times before, but the map merging has been less studied.

During underwater missions, autonomous robots have not access to a GPS positioning
and must rely on other sensors to  evaluate its position. The method used is a range only (with landmarks) SLAM
with Interval Analysis this method allow a guaranteed estimation of the errors.

When sweeping an unknown and hazardous area it is important to known for sure the position of the robot, to avoid obstacles or keep from damaging the environment. The method used to control the robot is the potential field
method which is adapted to an unknown environment. The implementation uses the ROS framework for communication and visualization.
 
The SLAM and control show promising results but need more tests and some tweaking to a more complete simulation.
